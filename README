== What ==

DiscogsTagger is a console based audio meta-data tagger. Artist profile data is 
retrieved via the discogs.com API.

Simply provide the script with a destination directory name, that contains an
album consisting of either FLAC or MP3 media files, and the discogs.com 
release-id. DiscogsTagger calls out to the discogs.com API and updates the
audio meta-data accordingly.

During the process, all album images (if present) are retrieved from the API. 
As well, a play-list (.m3u) and an information file (.nfo) are generated per
each release.

== Requirements ==

Mutagen
discogs-client - Packaged with DiscogsTagger 

== Installation ==

TODO

== Configuration ==

DiscogsTagger searches for the configuration file at the default location of
~/.discogs_tagger.conf, at run-time. Or you're able to specify the config 
location with the '-c' switch.

The configuration file must be present to execute the script. The default 
settings (as shipped), should work without any modifications.

== Examples ==

The following example tags a directory containing my FLAC backup of the album
"House For All - Volume 1" on Definitive Recordings (release id 135140).

The following example illustrates use of the discogs_tagger.Album class, which
wraps the discogs-client code.

$ ipython

In [4]: from discogs_tagger import Album
In [5]: r = Album(135140)
In [6]: for track in r.tracks.keys():
            print "%.2d. %s - %s" % (track, r.tracks[track][0], r.tracks[track][1])

01. Chuck Phulasole - Stargazer
02. Juicy Fruit - Liferaft (Stickmen's Mix)
03. Robotman - Dodadoo (J. Acquaviva's Mix)
04. Wax Fruit - Just A Party
05. Blunted Dummies - House For All
06. Math U Matix - Blue
07. Barada - Flesh
08. Omegaman - Homebass
09. Las Americas - Look, Listen, Love
10. Las Americas - Worship (Que Divina!) (Jetstream's Mix)
11. Barada - Glue
12. Robotman - Dodadoo (Plastikman's Mix)

== Further TODOs == 
    - String comparison to determine similarities between local track-list, and
      the discogs API response. Options = Levenshtein or difflib..
    - clean-up install, or setup-tools..
    - Support for multiple cds/directories

== Changelog ==

Version 0.6

- fix : artist name is now accessed from the release class, and not the Artist
class (reported by cmaussan)
